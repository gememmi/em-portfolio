        <p>
          My journey into the tech world started just before my boot camp
          at Flatiron School. As a creative and curious individual, I sought
          out online web development classes as a way to add breadth to the
          creative mediums I already practiced.Â Creating websites with
          interesting, but sometimes totally irrelevant use is a blossoming
          passion of mine, where I can exploremy creativity using
          programming skills.
